Logo & Branding
Contextualize the company name
“Smart Flow Systems” feels tech-centric, while the imagery (scissors, barber pole) leans into barbershop vibes. Consider tweaking the name to better reflect its function—something like Smart Cut Flow or BarberFlow Systems could link the brand more directly to grooming.
Refine the logo composition
The icon looks like a rounded square with a red dot. To harmonize with the text, ensure it's balanced (align baseline/height with your wordmark) and maybe introduce a subtle barber-related symbol—scissor handles, a barber pole, or a beard/mustache silhouette—crafted with clean lines that align with your chosen font.
Golden Ratio for logo spacing
Use the golden ratio (~1.618) to space the icon and text: if your icon is 40px high, leave about 65px gap before the wordmark. This subtle alignment introduces visual harmony.
🎨 Color & Aesthetics
Palette alignment
The soft grey background and navy text work well, but consider a complementary accent color—maybe a deeper crimson or teal (keeping barber tradition in mind). Use it sparingly for buttons and highlighting active days.
Visual hierarchy
The red blocks marking “Has bookings” on your calendar—often strong—could be toned down slightly (maybe a coral or muted red) to avoid overpowering the booking CTA.
📅 UX & Calendar Design
Legend placement
The calendar legend (“Today”, “Available”, “Has bookings”, “Selected”) is helpful—but you could tighten grouping or move it into a subtle tooltip or collapsible panel to declutter.
Hit targets
Mobile users tapping tiny “+2 more bookings” may struggle. Ensure those tappable elements are at least 44x44 px.
Consistent labeling
You have “Book 9:00” labels; on dates where times are automatically shown (like “9:00 AM”), it’s slightly inconsistent. Consider always prefixing with “Book” and including AM/PM, or always omit it for consistency.
🧭 Iconography & Tone
Use icon consistency: you have scissors, razor, barber pole. Ensure they share a consistent visual style (line weight, color fills). If you use filled icons for one, use filled for all.
UX Flow
Encourage quick selection: after picking a date and time, consider showing a floating sidebar or popover with “Confirm Appointment” so users don’t scroll too far for the form.
Micro-animations: subtle fades or color fills on hover/tap strengthen the “smart flow” vibe.
